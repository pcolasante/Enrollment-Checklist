# Enrollment-Checklist
Submission for the TADHack Orlando 2024.

Steps of Enrollment into Valencia College for prospectives students into the academic programs. 
Intent is to make it interactive and personalized for the student. 

Student can click on steps as they complete it, and see further information when interacting with it, such as links to Valencia College webpages/resources available to students.  

Optional goal is to make a bot assistant that can help/respond to students with general questions of the steps of enrollment.
Possibly attempt to make it so bot can research student profile or previous interactions to personalize the answer.
